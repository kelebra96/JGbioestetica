**Implementation Notes:**

The foundational brand guidelines and sitemap are now complete and serve as the primary input for this design task.

-   **Source of Truth:** All wireframes and high-fidelity mockups must be based on the specifications within:
    -   `./.taskmaster/docs/brand-guidelines.md`: For the complete visual identity, including the expanded color palette, typography, iconography, and voice/tone.
    -   `./.taskmaster/docs/sitemap.md`: For the full page structure, content hierarchy, and administrative pages.
-   **Design Scope:** Create designs for all pages defined in the sitemap, ensuring the visual language is consistent with the brand guidelines. This includes the 5 main pages and their sub-pages.
-   **Development Phasing:** Prioritize the creation of mockups according to the 3-phase development plan outlined in the sitemap document to facilitate a staged development process.
-   **Responsive Design:** Ensure mockups are created for both desktop and mobile views, taking into account the mobile navigation and SEO considerations detailed in the sitemap.
